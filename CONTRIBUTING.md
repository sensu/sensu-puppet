# Contribution Guidelines

## Tests

  - Pull requests that add any additional functionality should have tests which cover the new feature to ensure it does what is expected
  - Pull requests with failing tests will not be merged

## Features

  - Keep feature based PRs as small as possible, with as few commits as necessary. These are easier to review and will be merged quicker

## Bug Fixes

  - Make sure you reference the issue you're closing with `Fixes #<issue number>`

## Commits

  - Squash/rebase any commits where possible to reduce the noise in the PR
