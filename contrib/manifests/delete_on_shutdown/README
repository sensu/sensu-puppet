This is a short script / module that is great for use in cloud environments, especially AWS.

When you shutdown a box - or autoscaling does -  it removes the system from Sensu.

No need for credentials to AWS, or a  handler to see if an instance is terminated, etc.
This should take care of *most* of the day to day client removals.
